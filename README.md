This is a fun project I have made based on what I learned from an online course on Udemy.
This project is a way for me to train my machine learning skills and apply those lessons in this project.
The project is about predicting someone with a family history of being overweight based on three distinct variables.
1. Gender
2. Weight
3. Height
4. Age

The model that I used is all the classification models, such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighboor, SVM (Support Vector Machine), Decision Tree Classification, and Random Forest Classification.
From all the models, the highest F1 score is from Random Forest Classification with a score of 0.930635838150289 with the model's accuracy of  0.8865248226950354.
